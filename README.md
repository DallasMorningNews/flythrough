## Intro

This is a jquery plugin to be used in the building of fly arounds using video exported from Google Earth.

While most of the code is written for you, you will need to be familiar with <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/json/" target="_blank">JSON (Javascript Object Notation) </a>, and a little bit of HTML.
